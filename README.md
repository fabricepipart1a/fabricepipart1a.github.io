Developers very often need to code some automation, specially these days when everyone talks about DevOps. Immediately, the question comes to decide what technical framework we should use to code that automation. What language should we use? How do we distribute that automation?

Nowadays, a lot of people choose the road that Linux started paving decades ago. Linux scripting is based on foundations where everything is a binary that can be executed in a Terminal (aka Command Line). Developers can follow the same direction and create their own specific binary.


In this article, we'll see how to mix Java, Docker, tests, REST and Quarkus to create the ultimate Command Line tool. Are you ready for this ultimate melting-pot?
